## 🌟 Project Vision

**"The best for a better world"**

The Abandoned Vehicle Detection System aims to make urban spaces safer and more efficient through artificial intelligence technology.

We believe that a better world can be built through open source. We hope this project contributes to public safety, urban planning, and environmental improvement, helping to create cities where everyone can live better.

## 🎯 Project Overview

### Problems We're Solving

Long-term abandoned vehicles in modern cities cause the following social problems:

- 🚨 **Public Safety Threats**: Creation of criminal environments due to stolen/abandoned vehicles
- 🅿️ **Parking Space Waste**: Inefficient use of valuable urban resources
- 🏙️ **Urban Aesthetics**: Deterioration of residential environment due to abandoned vehicles
- 💰 **Increased Administrative Costs**: Labor and budget required for manual enforcement and processing

### Our Approach

This system automatically detects long-term abandoned vehicles by combining **VWorld Aerial Imagery API** and **ResNet50 deep learning model**.

**Core Principles:**
1. Extract vehicle features from satellite aerial imagery at specific locations
2. Determine vehicle movement through time-series comparison
3. Automatically determine abandonment using AI-based similarity analysis
4. Provide risk level classification and management priorities
